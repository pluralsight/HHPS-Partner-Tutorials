The terms _Growth Hacking_, _Link Bait_ and _Social Karma_ are being tossed around everywhere in the startup world these days. So what exactly do these buzzwords mean? According to the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking), growth hacking is a marketing technique which uses social metrics, analytical thinking and creativity to boost product sales and gain exposure.
