# TL;DR

This is a third post (first one is about [getting started on the MEAN stack](https://hackhands.com/how-to-get-started-on-the-mean-stack/), and the second one is all about [Node.js and Express](https://hackhands.com/delving-node-js-express-web-framework/)) in a series of posts which will teach you how to take the advantage of the MEAN stack in becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer.

In this post  youâ€™ll learn all about [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and how Node.js and Express work together with it - and all that in a MVC way. First you'll go over the basic CRUD commands, then you'll look at [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) and finally you'll learn how to add a register/login functionality by providing the options like email/password, Facebook and Twitter by using the [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) module.

_Disclaimer: code is based on the [MEAN.JS framework](http://meanjs.org/) and the tutorial partly follows the structure from [MEAN Web Development by Amos Haviv](http://amzn.to/1cvHyth)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=nikolab-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00NXWI1BM), the author of the MEAN.JS framework._


## Le finished project download

If you want to follow along but you dread typing, you can [clone the finished project from Github](https://github.com/Hitman666/MEAN_MVC_3rdTutorial.git). If you would like to test the project, you have to:

* run **npm install** after cloning
* make sure that you have **mongod** running on default 27017 port
* run **node server **from the root of the application (where the **server.js** file is placed)
* _if you'll want to test the Facebook and Twitter logins (and they don't work out of the box for you) you'll have to create your own Facebook and Twitter applications by following the steps in the [User authentication with Passport](#User_authentication_with_Passport)_

## Let's demystify this MongoDB thing

![willywonkaDBskills](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/willywonkaDBskills.jpg)

If you're developing for the web, it's almost certain that you're using a relational database ([PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), ...) to store your data. But, you may have found your self struck with scaling problems as your application started to grow. Many different storage design patterns emerged in an attempt to solve this problem (key-value storage, column storage, object storage), but the most popular one is **document storage**.

![yunoSQL](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/yunoSQL.jpg)

Generally, MongoDB is one of the [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) databases which is a term coined by [Carlo Strozzi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL#History). NoSQL systems are also called _Not only SQL_ to emphasize that they may also support SQL-like query languages.

![hatedRelational](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hatedRelational.jpg)

Document oriented databases handle data differently from a relational database. Instead of using **tables**, they store hierarchical **documents** in a standard **JSON** format. For example, in a document based database (the cliche _blog_ example) the _post_ will be stored **completely** as a **single document** that can later be queried, opposed to SQL where you would at least have 2 tables (_posts_, _comments_). In turn, this makes read operations faster since you don't have to query multiple tables.

### **Key features of MongoDB**

#### BSON

BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents, and it is designed to be more efficient in size and speed. BSON documents are a simple data structure representation of objects and arrays in a **key-value format**. A document consists of a list of elements, each with a string typed **field name** and a typed **field value**. Another big advantage of the BSON format is the use of the **_id** field as **primary key**.

The main problem of key-value stores is their limited query capabilities, which means your data can only be queried using the key field. MongoDB supports dynamically structured queries out of the box (so called [ad hoc queries](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2460954/what-is-ad-hoc-query)), by indexing BSON documents and using a unique query language.

MongoDB query language is similar to SQL:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM todos WHERE title LIKE '%milk%';</pre>
```

which selects all the rows from the **todos **table which contain a _milk_ word in a **title** field. The same query in MongoDB looks like this:

``` js
db.todos.find({ title:/milk/ });
```

MongoDB solves the issue of querying speed (as the database grows) by using a mechanism called **indexing**. [Indexes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index) are a unique data structure that enable the database engine to efficiently resolve queries. You can learn more about indexes [here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/indexes/).

### Replica set

MongoDB uses a so called **replica set** to provide data **redundancy** andimproved **availability**. Replication can help to recover data from (unfortunate) hardware failures. A replica set is a set of MongoDB services that host the **same dataset**. One service is used as the **primary **and others as **secondaries**. All replicas support read operations, but only the primary instance can use the **write** operations. When a write operation occurs, the primary will inform the secondaries about the changes and make sure they've applied it to their datasets' replication.

Another robust feature of the MongoDB replica set is its **automatic failover** which kicks into place when one of the set members can't reach the primary instance for more than 10 seconds, the replica set will automatically elect and promote a secondary instance as the new primary. When the old primary comes back online, it will rejoin the replica set as a _secondary_.

### Sharding

![scaling](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/scaling.jpg)

Scaling is not a problem. **Until it is**. If you create a small application for a dozen of users you don't have to worry (you would probably get away even with a few thousand users), but if you're application becomes Facebook popular, the scaling problem will hit you in the face.

![scalingIdontAlways](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/scalingIdontAlways.jpg)

So, if you get in trouble you have two possibilities to solve the scaling issue:

* **Vertical scaling** - easier, because you only have to buy additional hardware (RAM, CPU) of a **single machine**. But, this can only be done up to a certain point when buying additional hardware becomes way **more expensive** compared to splitting the load between several smaller (cheaper) machines.
* **Horizontal scaling** - more complicated and it's done using several machines. Each machine handles a part of the load, providing better overall performance. The challenge, however, is how to properly divide the data between different machines and manage the read/write operations between them.

MongoDB supports **horizontal scaling**, called sharding. **Sharding** is the process of splitting the data between different machines (shards), where each shard holds a portion of the data and functions as a separate database. How to deploy a shard cluster goes beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can read more about it on the [official site](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/deploy-shard-cluster/).

### Let's query the MongoDB via terminal

![batman](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/batman.jpg)

MongoDB shell (mongo.exe on Windows machine, mongo binary on Linux) will automatically connect to the default **test** database if you run it without any parameters. In order to switch to another database (in this example called _todos_) execute the following command:

``` js
use todos
```

Databases and collections are lazily created when you insert your first document, which means that if you use the **use todos** command from above, but you don't insert any documents, the database will not be created.

In order to show all the available databases execute the following command:

``` js
show dbs
```

A MongoDB **collection** is a **list** of MongoDB **documents** and is the equivalent of a
relational database **table**. Unlike a table, a collection **doesn't** enforce any type of **schema**. To show all available collections in the database execute:

``` js
show collections
```

#### Create

You can use three commands to create documents in MongoDB:

* insert

    * ``` js
    db.todos.insert({"title":"Write a post", "user": "nikola"})
    ```

* update

    * usually used to update an existing document, but if you set the **upsert** flag, it will create a new document if it does not exist:

    ``` js
    db.todos.update({
         "user": "nikola"
         },
         {
          "title": "Buy Bitcoins",
          "user": "nikola"
         },
         {
          upsert: true
         }
        )
    ```

* save

    * creates a new document even if the exact one (content wise) exists:

    ``` js
        db.todos.save({"title":"Write a post", "user": "nikola"})
    ```

#### Read

To find all the documents of the _todos_ collection, execute:

``` js
db.todos.find()
```

To find all the _todos_ of the user _nikola_ execute:

``` js
db.todos.find({ "user": "nikola" })
```

To find all _todos_ that were created by either _nikola_ or _josipa_, you can use the **$in** operator:

``` js
db.todos.find({ "user": { $in: ["josipa", "nikola"] } })
```

Another way to find all _todos_ that were created by either _nikola_ or _josipa_:

``` js
db.todos.find( { $or: [{ "user": "nikola" }, { "user": "josipa" }] })
```

To find all _todos_ that were created by _nikola_ and have a priority greater than 3:

``` js
db.todos.find({ "user": "nikola", "priority": { $gt: 3 } })
```

### Update

The _update()_ method takes three arguments to update existing documents:

1. selection that indicates which documents to update
2. update statement
3. options object

In the following example, the first argument is telling MongoDB to look for all the documents created by _nikola_ (in the _todos_ collection), the second argument tells it to update the _title_ field, and the third is forcing it to execute the update operation on all the documents it finds, since  the **default** behavior is to update a **single** document:

``` js
db.todos.update({
 "user": "nikola"
 },
 {
  $set: {
   "title": "Postpone blog post"
  }
 },
 {
  multi: true
 }
)
```

#### Delete

To remove all the documents from the _todos_ collection execute:

``` js
db.todos.remove()
```

To remove the **first** document from the todos collection made by user _nikola_ execute:

``` js
db.todos.remove({ "user": "nikola" }, true)
```

In order to remove **all** of the documents made by _nikola_ in the _todos_ collection just omit the **true** flag.

## Mongoose

[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) is a Node.js ODM (object document mapper) module that translates your objects in code to the document representation of the data in MongoDB. _You may be familiar with ORM, and you can see the difference explained [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12261866/what-is-the-difference-between-an-orm-and-an-odm)._ While MongoDB doesn't enforce a schema, Mongoose offers a stricter schema approach.

### Continue with the application

The following examples continue where we left off in the [second tutorial](https://hackhands.com/delving-node-js-express-web-framework/). So, feel free to [clone the second project from GitHub](https://github.com/Hitman666/MEAN_MVC_2ndTutorial) and follow along.

### Connect to MongoDB

First, you need to install Mongoose by issuing the following command (once you're in the project root folder - _and, just so I won't have to stress this every time; from now on every **npm install** command should be done from the project's root folder (where's your server.js file)_):

``` bash
npm install mongoose --save
```

To connect to MongoDB, you need to use the MongoDB connection URI, which looks like this:

``` text
mongodb://username:password@hostname:port/database
```

But, since you're connecting on a localhost (your own computer), you can skip the username and password part and use:

``` text
mongodb://localhost/todos
```

The simplest thing you could do is define this connection URI variable directly in your _config/__express.js_ configuration file and use the Mongoose module to connect to the database:

``` text
var uri = 'mongodb://localhost/todos';
var db = require('mongoose').connect(uri);
```

but this is bad practice. The proper way to store application variables is to use your environment configuration file. In the **config** folder create an **env** folder and inside it create a **development.js** file with the following code:

``` js
var port = 1337;

module.exports = {
 port: port,
 db: 'mongodb://localhost/todos'
};
```

Now, in your **config** folder, create a new file named **mongoose.js** with the following code:

``` js
var config = require('./config'),
 mongoose = require('mongoose');

module.exports = function() {
 var db = mongoose.connect(config.db);
 return db;
};
```

#### Environment configuration file

Hopeful reader as you are, you may have noticed that you're requiring the **./config** file which you do not yet have. To fix this, create a **config.js** file in the **config** folder and place the following code inside:

``` js
module.exports = require('./env/' + process.env.NODE_ENV + '.js');
```

This will let you load the correct db (and other variables that we'll define later) variable based on your environment (be it a _development_ or _production_) configuration file.

The **process.env** is a global variable that allows you to access predefined environment variables, and the most common one is **NODE_ENV**. To set it in a Windows environment execute the following command in your command prompt:

``` js
set NODE_ENV=development
```

and in an Unix-based environment execute:

``` js
export NODE_ENV=development
```

Now, update the **server.js** file to the following content (most of the code you already have, you're just adding the Mongoose specific code, along with environment variable setting):

``` js
process.env.NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';

var config = require('./config/config'),
 mongoose = require('./config/mongoose'),
 express = require('./config/express'),

var db = mongoose(),
 app = express();

app.listen(config.port);

module.exports = app;
console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV + ' server running at http://localhost:' + config.port);
```

Mongoose configuration file has to be loaded **before** any other configuration in the _server.js_ file (except the _config_ module) because any module that is loaded after this module will be able to use its models without loading it by itself.

_If you execute **node server** command in your terminal and get an error like 'Error: failed to connect to [localhost:27017]', make sure your MongoDB instance (mongod) is running. Also, if you get another error like 'ERROR: Insufficient free space for __journal files', make sure that you have at least 3379MB available on the drive where you installed it._

### Mongoose schemas

Since MongoDB doesn't enforce the documents to have the same structure, Mongoose offers just that by using a **Schema** object to define a list of properties, each with its own type and constraints.

To create a schema, create a new file named **user.server.model.js **in the **app/models** folder and paste the following code:

``` javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
 Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var UserSchema = new Schema({
 name: String,
 email: String,
 username: String,
 password: String,
});

mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

In order to use the _User_ model, you need to include this file by adding the following _require_ in the **config/mongoose.js** file (just before the **return db;** statement):

``` js
require('../app/models/user.server.model');
```

### Create a user

In order to keep things nice and tidy, you'll create a _Users_ controller which will handle all the requests for user related operations. In the **app/controllers** folder create a **users.server.controller.js** file and place the following code in it:

``` js
var User = require('mongoose').model('User');

exports.create = function(req, res, next) {
 var user = new User(req.body);
 user.save(function(err) {
  if (err) {
   return next(err);
  }
  else {
   res.json(user);
  }
 });
};
```

In the **app/routes** folder create a file named **users.server.routes.js** and paste the following code:

``` js
var users = require('../../app/controllers/users.server.controller');

module.exports = function(app) {
 app.route('/users').post(users.create);
};
```

In the **config/express.js** file add the following route definition:

``` js
require('../app/routes/users.server.routes.js')(app);
```

This is all we need for the RESTful user saving API, and in order to test it run

``` bash
$ node server
```

and issue the POST request with the following request body:

``` js
{
  "name": "Kevin",
 "email": "kevin@mitnick.com",
 "username": "Condor",
 "password": "AintNoBodyGotTimeForGoodPa$words!!!"
}
```

You can use the **curl** command like this:

``` bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Kevin", "email": "kevin@mitnick.com", "username": "Condor", "password": "AintNoBodyGotTimeForGoodPa$words!!!"}' localhost:1337/users
```

but I suggest you use a GUI tool since it will make things easier. I personally use [Postman](https://www.google.hr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Fpostman-rest-client%2Ffdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm&ei=GniuVMHZFYH9UMiSg9gC&usg=AFQjCNFL71vN61QG0LKlw7VDJvIZDprjHA&sig2=DUyqMgSFn1BFnWzvNlf_Sg) in Chrome, but I'm sure there's also a dozen of plugins for your favorite browser. However, if you followed all the steps you will notice that this curl command or Postman's POST aren't  working (sneaky, huh? ;)):

![postmanFail](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/postmanFail-1024x502.jpg)

You need install the [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) module which provides several middlewares to handle request data, and you can do that by executing the following command:

``` bash
$ npm install body-parser --save
```

After this, update your **express.js** file to look like this:

``` js
var config = require('./config'),
 express = require('express'),
 bodyParser = require('body-parser');

module.exports = function() {
 var app = express();

 app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
  extended: true
 }));

 app.use(bodyParser.json());

 app.set('views', './app/views');
 app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

 require('../app/routes/index.server.routes.js')(app);
 require('../app/routes/users.server.routes.js')(app);

 app.use(express.static('./public'));

 return app;
};
```

If you run **node server** now and try to POST the data again with Postman, you will see something like:

![postmanSuccess](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/postmanSuccess-1024x536.jpg)

_Important to note is that in my case (with Postman) I had to add the Content-Type header (application/json) manually for the request._

### Find all users

Great, so you created a new user in the _users_ collection. In order to list existing users add the following code to your **app/controllers/user.server.controller.js** file:

``` js
exports.list = function(req, res, next) {
 User.find({}, function(err, users) {
  if (err) {
   return next(err);
  }
  else {
   res.json(users);
  }
 });
};
```

Now you need to set up a route for this new method and in order to do so, go to your **app/routes/users.server.routes.js **file and change the **app.route** line to:

``` js
app.route('/users').post(users.create).get(users.list);
```

In order to test this run **node server** and enter [http://localhost:1337/users](http://localhost:1337/users) in your browser.

### Find one user

So, previous functionality gives you the list of all the users, but in order to show only one specific user in the **app/controllers/users.server.controller.js** file add the following code:

``` js
exports.read = function(req, res) {
 res.json(req.user);
};

exports.userByID = function(req, res, next, id) {
 User.findOne({
   _id: id
  },
  function(err, user) {
   if (err) {
    return next(err);
   }
   else {
    req.user = user;
    next();
   }
  }
 );
};
```

The **read()** method just responds with a JSON representation of the **req.user** object. The **userById()** method is populating the req.user object, which you will use as a middleware to deal with the manipulation of single documents when performing read, delete, and update operations.

Now, modify your **app/routes/users.server.routes.js** file to look like this:

``` js
var users = require('../../app/controllers/users.server.controller');

module.exports = function(app) {
 app.route('/users').post(users.create).get(users.list);

 app.route('/users/:userId').get(users.read);

 app.param('userId', users.userByID);
};
```

A colon before a substring in a route definition (in Express) means that this substring will be handled as a **request parameter**. To handle the population of the **req.user** object, you use the **app.param()** method that defines a middleware to be executed before any other middleware that uses that parameter. In your case the **users.userById()** method will be executed **before** any other middleware registered with the userId parameter, which in this case is the **users.read()** middleware.

_To test this, run **node server**, then navigate to [http://localhost:1337/users](http://localhost:1337/users) in your browser and grab one of your users' **_id** values (if you created more users by playing with Postman, if not - what are you waiting for? ;)), and navigate to [http://localhost:1337/users/[_id]](http://localhost:1337/users/[_id]),_
 _replacing the [_id] part with the user's _id value._

Mongoose offers a lot more options for searching and you can learn more about them in the [official documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-find).

### Update the user

Mongoose model has several available methods to update an existing
document: [update()](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.update), [findOneAndUpdate()](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findOneAndUpdate), and [findByIdAndUpdate()](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findByIdAndUpdate). Since you're already using the userById() method, you're going to use the findByIdAndUpdate() method.

In your **app/controllers/users.server.controller.js** file add a new update() method:

``` js
exports.update = function(req, res, next) {
 User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.user.id, req.body, function(err, user) {
  if (err) {
   return next(err);
  }
  else {
   res.json(user);
  }
 });
};
```

Now update your **app/routes/users.server.routes.js** file to this (_.put(users.update)_ is the novelty in this file):

``` js
var users = require('../../app/controllers/users.server.controller');

module.exports = function(app) {
 app.route('/users').post(users.create).get(users.list);

 app.route('/users/:userId').get(users.read).put(users.update);

 app.param('userId', users.userByID);
};
```

You can test this with a PUT command:

``` bash
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "UpdatedName"}' localhost:1337/users/[_id]
```

where **[_id]** is, of course, the valid _id_ of some user.

### Delete the user

I hope that by now you're seeing the pattern here - Mongoose model has several available methods to remove an existing document:
- [remove()](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.remove)
- [findOneAndRemove()](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findOneAndRemove)
- [findByIdAndRemove()](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findByIdAndRemove)

Since you're already using the userById() method, you're going to use the findByIdAndRemove() method.

In your **app/controllers/users.server.controller.js** file add a new delete() method:

``` js
exports.delete = function(req, res, next) {
 req.user.remove(function(err) {
  if (err) {
   return next(err);
  }
  else {
   res.json(req.user);
  }
 })
};
```

Now, in **app/routes/users.server.routes.js** file change the route with the _userId_ parameter to be like this:

``` js
app.route('/users/:userId').get(users.read).put(users.update).delete(users.delete);
```

To test the delete method, run **node server** and issue a DELETE request,  example with curl (OFC replace [_id_] as before):

``` bash
$ curl -X DELETE localhost:1337/users/[id]
```

### Few additional goodies

#### Indexes

A **unique** index validates the uniqueness of a document field across a collection. Since you most likely want the _username_ to be unique, you have to add this to your _User_ model:

``` js
var UserSchema = new Schema({
  ...
  username: {
    type: String,
    unique: true
  },
  ...
});
```

Mongoose also supports **secondary indexes** using the **index** property. So, if you know that your application will use a lot of queries with the _email_ field, you could optimize these queries by creating an _email _secondary_ index:

``` js
var UserSchema = new Schema({
  ...
  email: {
    type: String,
    index: true
  },
  ...
});
```

#### Mongoose middleware

Mongoose has **pre** and **post** middlewares which execute, as you may imagine, pre and post some operation. Template looks like this:

``` js
UserSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
if (something) {
next()
} else {
next(new Error('No can do, sir!'));
}
});
```

So, basically, before you save something to MongoDB some action is performed before that - you will use this later for hashing the password before saving it to the MongoDB.

_Mongoose lets you configure a lot more options like [default values](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/defaults.html),  [custom getters/setters](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/getters-setters.html), [virtual attributes](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/virtuals.html), [custom methods and statics](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/methods-statics.html), [custom validation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/validation.html), [custom references to other document inside a document](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/populate.html) about which you can learn more on the respective links._

## User authentication with Passport

![registeringIdontAlways](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/registeringIdontAlways.jpg)

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) is a Node.js authentication middleware that authenticates requests sent to your Express application. It offers both local authentication (username/password) and OAuth authentication (Facebook, Twitter, Github, Google, ... - full list [here](http://passportjs.org/guide/providers/).) methods called **strategies**.

In order to install Passport execute:

``` bash
$ npm install passport --save
```

Now, add the following two lines in the **server.js** file:

``` js
passport = require('./config/passport');
...
var passport = passport();
```

Also, require it in the **config/express.js** file like this:

``` js
passport = require('passport');

//use this code before any route definitions
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());
```

Now you need to install at least one **authentication strategy**, and here I'll show you three: local strategy (username/password) authentication, Facebook OAuth authentication and Twitter OAuth authentication with exact steps.

### Local authentication strategy

First, install the local strategy authentication module:

``` bash
$ npm install passport-local --save
```

Now, in the config **folder**, create a new folder called **strategies** and a new file **local.js** with the following code:

``` js
var passport = require('passport'),
 LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy,
 User = require('mongoose').model('User');

module.exports = function() {
 passport.use(new LocalStrategy(function(username, password, done) {
  User.findOne(
   {username: username},
   function(err, user) {
    if (err) {
     return done(err);
    }

    if (!user) {
     return done(null, false, {message: 'Unknown user'});
    }

    if (!user.authenticate(password)) {
     return done(null, false, {message: 'Invalid password'});
    }

    return done(null, user);
   }
  );
 }));
};
```

Here you first require the Passport module, then the local strategy module's Strategy object, and finally your _User_ Mongoose model. Then, you register the strategy using the **passport.use()** method that uses an instance of the LocalStrategy object. Inside the callback function you use the _User_ Mongoose model to find a user with the passed username and try to authenticate it.

Now, create a **passport.js** file in the **config** folder and add this code:

``` js
var passport = require('passport'),
 mongoose = require('mongoose');

module.exports = function() {
 var User = mongoose.model('User');

 passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {
  done(null, user.id);
 });

 passport.deserializeUser(function(id, done) {
  User.findOne(
   {_id: id},
   '-password',
   function(err, user) {
    done(err, user);
   }
  );
 });

 require('./strategies/local.js')();
};
```

With **passport.serializeUser()** and **passport.deserializeUser()** methods you defined how Passport will handle user serialization. When a user is authenticated, Passport will save its _id property to the session. When the user object will be needed Passport will use the _id property to fetch the user object from the database. Also, you included the local strategy
configuration file so once you load the Passport configuration file in server.js, it then loads its strategies configuration file. The **-password** option is set so that Mongoose doesn't fetch the password field.

Next, you need to modify your _User_ model to support Passport authentication, and to do that update **models/user.server.model.js** file to this code:

``` js
var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
 crypto = require('crypto'),
 Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var UserSchema = new Schema({
 name: String,
 email: String,
 username: {
  type: String,
  trim: true,
  unique: true
 },
 password: String,
 provider: String,
 providerId: String,
 providerData: {},
 todos: {}//we will use this in the next tutorial to store TODOs
});

UserSchema.pre('save',
 function(next) {
  if (this.password) {
   var md5 = crypto.createHash('md5');
   this.password = md5.update(this.password).digest('hex');
  }

  next();
 }
);

UserSchema.methods.authenticate = function(password) {
 var md5 = crypto.createHash('md5');
 md5 = md5.update(password).digest('hex');

 return this.password === md5;
};

UserSchema.statics.findUniqueUsername = function(username, suffix, callback) {
 var _this = this;
 var possibleUsername = username + (suffix || '');

 _this.findOne(
  {username: possibleUsername},
  function(err, user) {
   if (!err) {
    if (!user) {
     callback(possibleUsername);
    }
    else {
     return _this.findUniqueUsername(username, (suffix || 0) + 1, callback);
    }
   }
   else {
    callback(null);
   }
  }
 );
};

mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

In this mumbo jumbo you've added three fields to your UserSchema object:

* **provider** property - the strategy used to register the user
* **providerId** property - the user identifier for the authentication strategy
* **providerData** property - you'll use it later to store the user object retrieved from OAuth providers

![plaintextPasswords](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/plaintextPasswords.jpg)

Next, you created a **pre-save middleware** (mentioned above in the Mongoose section) to handle the users' password hashing, since storing a clear text passwords in the database (any database for that matter) is a big fat NoNo. The pre-save middleware creates a MD5 hash of the password (using the [crypto](http://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) module) and then it replaces the current user password with a hashed one.

Before you jump the boat and go like:

![wonka-md5](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wonka-md5.jpg)

you can use a more advanced example which uses salts [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17201450/salt-and-hash-password-in-nodejs-w-crypto).

Also, you added an **authenticate()** method, which accepts a string password argument, which it then hashes and compares to the current users hashed password. Finally, you added the **findUniqueUsername()** static method, which is used to find an available unique username for new users (used later with OAuth authentication examples).

#### Login page

![LoginWithoutFB](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/LoginWithoutFB.jpg)

You need a login page where you'll give your users options to login in. You'll use a small [Bootstrap login](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/signin/) example to make it look nicer. Create a new **login.ejs** file in the **views** folder and paste the following code:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <title>
  <%=title %>
 </title>

 <link href="http://getbootstrap.com/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/signin/signin.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
 <% for(var i in messages) { %>
  <div class="flash">
   <%= messages[i] %>
  </div>
 <% } %>

 <div class="container">
  <form class="form-signin" action="/login" method="post">
         <h2 class="form-signin-heading text-center">Open, says me</h2>

         <label for="username" class="sr-only">Username</label>
         <input type="text" name="username" id="username" class="form-control" placeholder="Username" required autofocus>

         <label for="password" class="sr-only">Password</label>
         <input type="password" name="password" id="password" class="form-control" placeholder="Password">

         <button class="btn btn-lg btn-primary btn-block" type="submit">Login</button>
       </form>

       <div class="row">
      <div class="center-block text-center">
    <a href="/oauth/facebook">Login with Facebook</a> |
    <a href="/oauth/twitter">Login with Twitter</a>
   </div>
  </div>
    </div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Register page

![register](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/register.jpg)

Create a new **register.ejs** file in the **views** folder and paste the following code:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <title>
  <%=title %>
 </title>

 <link href="http://getbootstrap.com/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/signin/signin.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
 <% for(var i in messages) { %>
 <div class="flash"><%= messages[i] %></div>
 <% } %>

 <div class="container">
  <form class="form-signin" action="/register" method="post">
         <h2 class="form-signin-heading text-center">Register</h2>

         <label for="username" class="sr-only">Username</label>
         <input type="text" id="username" name="username" class="form-control" placeholder="Username" required autofocus>

         <label for="name" class="sr-only">Name</label>
         <input type="text" id="name" name="name" class="form-control" placeholder="Name" required autofocus>

         <label for="email" class="sr-only">E-mail</label>
         <input type="email" id="email" name="email" class="form-control" placeholder="E-mail" required>

         <label for="password" class="sr-only">Password</label>
         <input type="password" name="password" id="password" class="form-control" placeholder="Password" required>

         <button class="btn btn-lg btn-primary btn-block" type="submit">Register</button>
       </form>

       <div class="row">
      <div class="center-block text-center">
    <a href="/oauth/facebook">Login with Facebook</a> |
    <a href="/oauth/twitter">Login with Twitter</a>
   </div>
  </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

One thing you should note in the login.ejs and register.ejs files are the **name** parameters of the input fields - they correspond to the Mongoose _User_ model fields.

### Users controller modifications

Change the **app/controllers/users.server.controller.js** file to look like this:

``` js
var User = require('mongoose').model('User'),
 passport = require('passport');

var getErrorMessage = function(err) {
 var message = '';
 if (err.code) {
  switch (err.code) {
   case 11000:
   case 11001:
    message = 'Username already exists';
    break;
   default:
    message = 'Something went wrong';
  }
 }
 else {
  for (var errName in err.errors) {
   if (err.errors[errName].message)
    message = err.errors[errName].message;
  }
 }

 return message;
};

exports.renderLogin = function(req, res, next) {
 if (!req.user) {
  res.render('login', {
   title: 'Log-in Form',
   messages: req.flash('error') || req.flash('info')
  });
 }
 else {
  return res.redirect('/');
 }
};

exports.renderRegister = function(req, res, next) {
 if (!req.user) {
  res.render('register', {
   title: 'Register Form',
   messages: req.flash('error')
  });
 }
 else {
  return res.redirect('/');
 }
};

exports.register = function(req, res, next) {
 if (!req.user) {
  var user = new User(req.body);
  var message = null;
  user.provider = 'local';
  user.save(function(err) {
   if (err) {
    var message = getErrorMessage(err);
    req.flash('error', message);
    return res.redirect('/register');
   }

   req.login(user, function(err) {
    if (err)
     return next(err);

    return res.redirect('/');
   });
  });
 }
 else {
  return res.redirect('/');
 }
};

exports.logout = function(req, res) {
 req.logout();
 res.redirect('/');
};
```

The **register()** method uses your _User_ model to create new users, so that it first creates a user object from the HTTP request body. Then, it tries to save it to MongoDB and if an error occurs, the register() method will use the **getErrorMessage()** method to fetch the errors. If the user was created successfully, the user session will be created using the **req.login()** method provided by Passport module. After the login operation is completed, a user object will be inside the req.user object.

#### Le errors

The [Connect-Flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-flash) module stores temporary messages in a session object called **flash**. Messages stored in the flash object will be cleared once they are presented to the user.

That's great stuff, install it:

``` bash
npm install connect-flash --save
```

Then, add the following lines to your **express.js** file:

``` js
var flash = require('connect-flash');
app.use(flash());
```

The Connect-Flash module exposes the **req.flash()** method, which allows you to create and retrieve flash messages.

#### Show me the routes

You need to wire up the routes for login and register, so in **users.server.routes.js** add:

``` js
app.route('/users').post(users.create).get(users.list);

 app.route('/users/:userId').get(users.read).put(users.update).delete(users.delete);

 app.param('userId', users.userByID);

 app.route('/register')
  .get(users.renderRegister)
  .post(users.register);

 app.route('/login')
  .get(users.renderLogin)
  .post(passport.authenticate('local', {
   successRedirect: '/',
   failureRedirect: '/login',
   failureFlash: true
  }));

 app.get('/logout', users.logout);
```

In the **index.server.controller.js** file add:

``` js
exports.render = function(req, res) {
    res.render('index', {
     title: 'MEAN MVC',
     user: req.user ? req.user.username : ''
    });
};
```

In **index.ejs** file add:

``` html
<% if ( user ) { %>
 <h2>Hello <%=user%> </h2>
 <a href="/logout">Logout</a>
<% } else { %>
 <a href="/register">Register</a>
 <a href="/login">Login</a>
<% } %>
```

If you run this with **node server** now, you will get the error '_Error: req.flash() requires sessions_'. Well, you can fix this quickly by installing the [sessions](https://github.com/expressjs/session) module:

``` bash
$ npm install express-session --save
```

and require it in the **express.js** file and add the _use_ statement:

``` js
var session = require('express-session');

app.use(session({
 saveUninitialized: true,
 resave: true,
 secret: 'OurSuperSecretCookieSecret'
}));
```

### Facebook OAuth strategy

[OAuth](http://oauth.net/) is an authentication protocol that allows users to register with your web application using an external _provider_, without the need to input their username and password.

![loginfacebook2](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/loginfacebook2.jpg)

OAuth is mainly used by social platforms (Facebook, Twitter, ...) to allow users to register with other websites using their social account.

In **app/controllers/users.server.controller.js** file add the following module method:

``` js
exports.saveOAuthUserProfile = function(req, profile, done) {
 User.findOne({
   provider: profile.provider,
   providerId: profile.providerId
  },
  function(err, user) {
   if (err) {
   return done(err);
   }
   else {
    if (!user) {
     var possibleUsername = profile.username || ((profile.email) ? profile.email.split('@')[0] : '');
     User.findUniqueUsername(possibleUsername, null, function(availableUsername) {
      profile.username = availableUsername;
      user = new User(profile);

      user.save(function(err) {
       if (err) {
        var message = _this.getErrorMessage(err);
        req.flash('error', message);
        return res.redirect('/signup');
       }

       return done(err, user);
      });
     });
    }
    else {
     return done(err, user);
    }
   }
  }
 );
};
```

This method accepts a user profile, and then looks for an existing user with _providerId_ and _provider_ properties. If the user is found, it calls the done() callback method with the user's MongoDB document. However, if an existing user isn't found, it will find a unique username using the _User _model's findUniqueUsername() static method and save a new user instance. If an error occurs, the saveOAuthUserProfile() method will use the req.flash() and getErrorMessage() methods to report the error; otherwise, it will pass the user object to the done() callback method.

Now, install the Facebook strategy module:

``` bash
npm install passport-facebook --save
```

#### Create a Facebook application

Before you can configure your Facebook strategy, you have to go to Facebook's developer home page at [https://developers.facebook.com/](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create a new Facebook application:

![fbApp_11](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fbApp_11.jpg)

On the next dialog select Website:

![fbApp_2](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fbApp_2.jpg)

Click on the _Skip and Create App ID_ button:

![fbApp_3](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fbApp_3.jpg)

On the next dialog enter the _Display Name_ of the application, select the _Category_ and click on the _Create App ID _button:

![Screen Shot 2015-01-12 at 20.46.24](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-12-at-20.46.24.png)

You need to do few more things:

1. Click on the **Settings**, then **+ Add Platform **and select **Website**. Enter [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) as the **Site URL** and **Save Changes.**
    ![Screen Shot 2015-01-12 at 21.38.24](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-12-at-21.38.24.png)

2. Take special note of the **App ID** and **App Secret** values, you'll need them later in code.

3. Click on the **Advanced** tab and insert [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) for the **Valid OAuth redirect URIs **and **Save Changes**:
    ![fbApp_7](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fbApp_7.jpg)

#### Set the strategy

Go to the **config/env/development.js** file and change it as follows:

``` js
var port = 1337;

module.exports = {
 port: port,
 db: 'mongodb://localhost/todos',
 facebook: {
  clientID: 'App ID',
  clientSecret: 'App Secret',
  callbackURL: 'http://localhost:'+ port +'/oauth/facebook/callback'
 }
};
```

You need to enter your own App ID as cliendID, and App secret as clientSecret (values which you got when you made your Facebook applicaiton).

Now, go to your **config/strategies** folder, and create a new file named **facebook.js** and place the following code:

``` js
var passport = require('passport'),
 url = require('url'),
 FacebookStrategy = require('passport-facebook').Strategy,
 config = require('../config'),
 users = require('../../app/controllers/users.server.controller');

module.exports = function() {
 passport.use(new FacebookStrategy({
  clientID: config.facebook.clientID,
  clientSecret: config.facebook.clientSecret,
  callbackURL: config.facebook.callbackURL,
  passReqToCallback: true
 },
 function(req, accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
  var providerData = profile._json;
  providerData.accessToken = accessToken;
  providerData.refreshToken = refreshToken;

  var providerUserProfile = {
   name: profile.name.givenName,
   email: profile.emails[0].value,
   username: profile.username,
   provider: 'facebook',
   providerId: profile.id,
   providerData: providerData
  };

  users.saveOAuthUserProfile(req, providerUserProfile, done);
 }));
};
```

In this code you first require the needed modules, and then you register the strategy using the passport.use() method where you create an instance of a FacebookStrategy object which you populate with the needed parameters. Inside the callback function, you create a new user object using the Facebook profile information and the controller's saveOAuthUserProfile() method.

Finally, in the **config/passport.js** file require this strategy:

``` js
require('./strategies/facebook.js')();
```

#### Set the routes

Now, all that you have to do is set the routes needed to authenticate users via Facebook and include links to those routes in your login and register pages.

In **app/routes/users.server.routes.js** file add the following code after the local strategy routes definition:

``` js
app.get('/oauth/facebook', passport.authenticate('facebook', {
 failureRedirect: '/login',
 scope:['email']
}));

app.get('/oauth/facebook/callback', passport.authenticate('facebook', {
 failureRedirect: '/login',
 successRedirect: '/',
 scope:['email']
}));
```

_The scope:['email'] is important as per [these instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22880876/passport-facebook-authentication-is-not-providing-email-for-all-fbaccounts)._

The first route uses the passport.authenticate() method to start the user authentication process, and the second route uses the same method, but this time to finish the authentication process once the user has linked his Facebook profile.

#### Set the links

Finally, in **app/views/register.ejs** and **app/views/login.ejs **files add the following line of code right before the closing BODY tag:

``` html
<a href="/oauth/facebook">Login with Facebook</a>
```

### Twitter OAuth strategy

First, install the Twitter strategy  module:

``` bash
npm install passport-twitter --save
```

#### Create a Twitter application

Go to  [Twitter developer page](https://apps.twitter.com/) and click on the _Create New App _button:

![Twitter_1](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Twitter_1.jpg)

Set _Name_, _Description_, _Website_ and most importantly _Callback URL_:

![Twitter_2](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Twitter_2-1024x650.jpg)

Click on the _Keys and Access Tokens_ tab:

![Twitter_3](http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Twitter_3.jpg)

#### Set the strategy

Take note of the _Consumer Key (API key)_ and _Consumer Secret (API secret)_ values; enter them in the **config/env/development.js** file:

``` js
twitter: {
 clientID: 'API key',
 clientSecret: 'API secret',
 callbackURL: 'http://localhost:1337/oauth/twitter/callback'
}
```

Now, create a new **twitter.js** file in the **config/strategies** folder and put the following code inside:

``` js
var passport = require('passport'),
 url = require('url'),
 TwitterStrategy = require('passport-twitter').Strategy,
 config = require('../config'),
 users = require('../../app/controllers/users.server.controller');

module.exports = function() {
 passport.use(new TwitterStrategy({
  consumerKey: config.twitter.clientID,
  consumerSecret: config.twitter.clientSecret,
  callbackURL: config.twitter.callbackURL,
  passReqToCallback: true
  },
  function(req, token, tokenSecret, profile, done) {
   var providerData = profile._json;
   providerData.token = token;
   providerData.tokenSecret = tokenSecret;
   var providerUserProfile = {
    fullName: profile.displayName,
    username: profile.username,
    provider: 'twitter',
    providerId: profile.id,
    providerData: providerData
   };

   users.saveOAuthUserProfile(req, providerUserProfile, done);
  }));
};
```

In this code you first require the needed modules, and then you register the strategy using the passport.use() method where you create an instance of a TwitterStrategy object which you populate with the needed parameters. Inside the callback function, you created a new user object using the Twitter profile information and the controller's saveOAuthUserProfile() method.

In the **config/passport.js** file add the following line (after the line where you require Facebook strategy):

``` js
require('./strategies/twitter.js')();
```

#### Set the routes

Now add the routes in the **app/routes/users.server.routes.js** file:

``` js
app.get('/oauth/twitter', passport.authenticate('twitter', {
 failureRedirect: '/login'
}));

app.get('/oauth/twitter/callback', passport.authenticate('twitter', {
 failureRedirect: '/login',
 successRedirect: '/'
}));
```

Same as in the Facebook case, the first route uses the passport.authenticate() method to start the user authentication process, and the second route uses the same method, but this time to finish the authentication process once the user has linked his Twitter profile.

#### Set the links

Finally, in **app/views/register.ejs** and **app/views/login.ejs **files add the following line of code right before the closing BODY tag:

``` html
  <a href="/oauth/twitter">Login with Twitter</a>
```

### Other OAuth providers

I think you go the gist on how to add OAuth to your MEAN application. Passport has similar support for many additional OAuth providers, and  to learn more visit [http://passportjs.](http://passportjs.%20org/guide/providers/)[org/guide/providers/](http://passportjs.%20org/guide/providers/).

## Le wrap up
